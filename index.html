                              Vision and Graph Group (VGG) is affiliated with the PCA Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology.<br>
                              The VGGâ€™s study covers Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, the study group focuses on graph learning (graph neural network), vision perception & computation (segmentation/detection/tracking), face analysis (emotion), etc. In addition, VGG also pays attention to many applications such as anomaly detection, intelligent agent, etc.
                              The study group aims to develop/create novel intelligent theories/methods to solve some key problems in CV & AI.<br>
                              Currently, the group contains more than 30 members totally, three full-time teachers among them.
